As solid tumors outgrow the surrounding vasculature, they encounter microenvironments with a limited supply of nutrients leading to a glucose deprived environment in some regions of the tumor. Cancer cells living in the glucose deprived environment undergo changes to prevent glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis. Knowing how cancer cells evade apoptosis induction is also likely to yield valuable information and knowledge of how to overcome the resistance to apoptosis induction in cancer cells.

As such, STAT3 has been recognized as a promising target for cancer therapy. Although a number of inhibitors of STAT3-STAT3 dimerization have been reported, molecular ligands that prevent interactions between STAT3 and DNA are very rare. The ��-AApeptide-based one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library was used, and identified ��-AApeptides that can selectively inhibit STAT3/DNA interaction and suppress the expression levels of STAT3 target genes in intact cells. The results not only validate ��-AApeptides as novel inhibitors of STAT3 signaling pathway, but also demonstrate that in addition to the SH2 domain, the DNA binding domain of STAT3 is targetable for the development of new generation of anti-cancer therapeutics.

In some embodiments, the resistance mechanism may be a frictional resistance mechanism, such as a drum or disc brake assembly. A user-operated control actuator allows the user to readily change resistance settings to increase or decrease the rotational resistance imparted to the support shaft by the resistance mechanism. In some implementations, the chassis may be detachably mounted on vertical supports of a power rack and adjustable in height for performing different exercise routines.""";"22";"21";"27";AU - Active Withdrawn Active Active , EP - Active Withdrawn Active Active , CA - Active Withdrawn Active Active , US - Abandoned, WO - Active Withdrawn Active Active

A single dose of DMA before TBI protect mice from GI and HP acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and offered radioprotection through oral, i.v., i.p., and s.c route of administration. The half life of DMA in plasma is 3.5 h at oral dose and 90% clearance was observed in 16 h. DMA accumulates in high concentration in intestine, liver, kidney and spleen tissues, justifying the observed radioprotection to normal tissue even at single dose.

The repetitions of an elementary component are sorted according to a function of the quality attributes of these repetitions. Certain repetitions, dubbed individualities, of an elementary component are selected.

The method involves dictionary data including feature quantities calculated from blocks forming a recognition-targeted region including a recognition-targeted image and having blocks concerning the region. Focusing on one block in the image plane, feature quantities are calculated, which make block-of-interest feature quantities. With each of ROIs including the block, inner products of feature quantities calculated from a block corresponding to the one block in the dictionary data, and block-of-interest feature quantities are accumulatively added into evaluation value intermediate data for ROI. Whether or not each ROI includes the recognition-targeted image is determined on an evaluation value of ROI on which the accumulative addition has been finished on all of blocks forming the ROI. The noticed blocks are sequentially scanned in the image plane.""";"20";"9";"5";JP - Pending, US - Active
